    "### Course Description\n",
    "Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations—collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments—form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It is helpful to put statistics in the context of a general process of investigation: 1) identify a question or problem; 2) collect relevant data on the topic; 3) analyze the data; and 4) form a conclusion. In this course, you'll focus on the first two steps of the process.\n",

    "#### 1.4.2)Combining levels of a different factor\n",
    "Another common way of creating a new variable based on an existing one is by combining levels of a categorical variable. For example, the `email50` dataset has a categorical variable called `number` with levels `\"none\"`, `\"small\"`, and `\"big\"`, but suppose we're only interested in whether an email contains a number. In this exercise, we will create a variable containing this information and also visualize it.\n",

The clusters, unlike strata in stratified sampling, are heterogeneous within themselves and each cluster is similar to the others, such that we can get away with sampling from just a few of the clusters.\n",
