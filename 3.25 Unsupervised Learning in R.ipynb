    "### Course Description\n",
    "Many times in machine learning, the goal is to find patterns in data without trying to make predictions. This is called unsupervised learning. One common use case of unsupervised learning is grouping consumers based on demographics and purchasing history to deploy targeted marketing campaigns. Another example is wanting to describe the unmeasured factors that most influence crime differences between cities. This course provides a basic introduction to clustering and dimensionality reduction in R from a machine learning perspective, so that you can get from data to insights as quickly as possible.\n",

By the end of the chapter, you'll have applied k-means clustering to a fun \"real-world\" dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) (video) Welcome to the course!\n",
    "In the first chapter, I'll define `unsupervised learning` providing overview the 3 major types of machine learning and you will learn execute one particular  type of unsupervised learning using R.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 major types of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Unsupervised learning: the goal in unsupervised learning is find structure in unlabeled data (unlabeled data is data whith out target , without lebeled response)\n",
    "    2) Supervised learning : it´s use when you want make predictions on labeled data  (type of predictions include: regresion or predictive how much something  there is or could be and classification which is predicting what type or class something is or could be)  \n",
    "    3) Reinforcement learning, when computer learn feedback operating in real or synthetic enviroment \n",
    "\n",
    " In unsupervised learning there are 2 major goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) findig homegenous subgroup within larger group (clustering)\n",
    "    2) finding patterns in the features of the data one way to do this is by `dimensionality reduction`, it's a method to decrease the number of features to describre an observation, and how mantain the maximum information contet under to constrain lower dimensionality.\n",

    "### 1.2) (video) Introduction to k-means clustering\n",
    "k-means is a clustering algorithm, an algorithm that try to find homogeneous subgroups with in a population, this works by first assuming the numbers of the subgroups of clusters in the data and then assign each observation to one of these subgroups.\n",

    "#### 1.2.1) Results of kmeans()\n",
    "The `kmeans()` function produces several outputs. In the video, we discussed one output of modeling, the cluster membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will access the `cluster` component directly. This is useful anytime you need the cluster membership for each observation of the data used to build the clustering model. A future exercise will show an example of how this cluster membership might be used to help communicate the results of k-means modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1) Handling random algorithms\n",
    "In the video, you saw how `kmeans()` randomly initializes the centers of clusters. This random initialization can result in assigning observations to different cluster labels. Also, the random initialization can result in finding different local minima for the k-means algorithm. This exercise will demonstrate both results.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of each plot, the measure of model quality—total within cluster sum of squares error—will be plotted. Look for the model(s) with the lowest error to find models with the better model results.\n",

If you know the number of clusters in advance (e.g. due to certain business constraints) this makes setting the number of clusters easy. However, as you saw in the video, if you do not know the number of clusters and need to determine it, you will need to run the algorithm multiple times, each time with a different number of clusters. From this, you can observe how a measure of model quality changes with the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will run `kmeans()` multiple times to see how model quality changes as the number of clusters changes. Plots displaying this information help to determine the number of clusters and are often referred to as **scree plots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal plot will have an **elbow** where the quality measure improves more slowly as the number of clusters increases. This indicates that the quality of the model is no longer improving substantially as the model complexity (i.e. number of clusters) increases.

Synthetic data helps with learning new concepts and techniques, but the next few exercises will deal with data that is closer to the type of real data you might find in your professional or academic pursuits.\n",

Think about how you would use plotting and clustering to communicate interesting groups of Pokemon to other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional note: this exercise utilizes the `iter.max` argument to `kmeans()`. As you've seen, `kmeans()` is an iterative algorithm, repeating over and over until some stopping criterion is reached. The default number of iterations for `kmeans()` is `10`, which is not enough for the algorithm to converge and reach its stopping criterion, so we'll set the number of iterations to `50` to overcome this issue. To see what happens when `kmeans()` does not converge, try running the example with a lower number of iterations (e.g. 3).

    "### 2.1) (video) Introduction to hierarchical clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is used when the number of cluster is not know ahead of time \n",
    "- there are 2 approaches : `bottom-up` and `top-down`, in this course we will focused in `bottom-up` \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see an example of 5 observation and 2 features:\n",
    "1. bottom-up clustering starts by assigning each observation as a cluster \n",
    "2. Next the `bottom-up`  clustering find the closest two cluster and joined them together in a single cluster\n",
    "3. this process continues iteratively finding the next pair of clusteres, that there are closest each other and combaining them in a single clusters.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2.2 (video) Selecting number of clusters\n",
    "now you have created your first hierarchical clustering in R it's time to see how interpret it, if you look the model through to the function `summary` the output would be very technique and it's not very useful honestly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way interprete a hierarchical clustering is though a `dendogram` in which you represent each obsevation and their group or subgroup respectevely and on the axis y, we will represent the distance between each cluster or `height` (in our case euclidean distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dendogram in R our output of model is passed to \"plot\" function \n",
    "\n",
    "    #draws a dendogram\n",
    "    plot(hclust.out)\n",
    "\n",
    "the next step typically in hierarchical clustering is determine the number of clusters you want in the model, this is one key model selecting step in the algorithm, a way to think about this is strong cut line on particular \"hight\" or \"distance \"  between the clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "    #one option is\n",
    "    abline(h = 6, col = \"red\")\n",

    "### 2.3 (video) Clustering linkage and practical matters\n",
    "There are some details that are important to cover before to continue with our method like:  how is distance between clusters determined? after the method clustering two first observations, the method needs rules, how measure the distance between clusters? there are four methods in R to measure similiarity between clusters (it to determine wich clusters shoul be linked).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Complete` : pairwise similarity between all observations in cluster 1 and cluster 2, and uses largest of similarities.\n",
    "- `Single` same as above but uses smallest of similarities.\n",
    "- `Average`: same as above but uses average of similarities\n",
    "- ` Centroid` : find centroid of cluster 1 and centroid of cluster 2, and uses similarity between two centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "linkage `Complete` criteria produces balanced tree and it is the most common used, other hand `single` produce unbalanced trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define this behavior only  using the `method` paramether on `hclust` function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #fitting hierarchical clustering models using different methods\n",

    "    h.clust.single<-hclust(d, method = \"single\")\n",
    "\n",
    "other practical matter is when your data has different scales, these can cause undesirable result in clustering methods to resolve this the data is transformed to linear transormations before performing clustering, this transformation substracs the mean of a feature from all observations and divide each feature by the standart deviation of the feature, this called normalization (we need to do the previous  solution if any features have different scales, even when the same scales are avalible over each feature, it´s good practive because the features can could have diffrente variabilities)\n",

    "In this exercise, you will go back to working with \"real\" data, the `pokemon` dataset introduced in the first chapter. You will observe the distribution (mean and standard deviation) of each feature, scale the data accordingly, then produce a hierarchical clustering model using the complete linkage method.\n",

    "- Missing values (you can handle it by in two ways):\n",
    "    - Drop observation with missing values\n",
    "    - impute/estimate missing values\n",
    "- Categorical data:\n",
    "    - Do not use categorical data features\n",
    "    - Encode categorical features as numbers \n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: you can scaling your data with the paramether `scale = TRUE` inside the function `prcomp`.\n",

    "Sometimes scaling is appropriate when the variances of the variables are substantially different. This is commonly the case when variables have different units of measurement, for example, degrees Fahrenheit (temperature) and miles (distance). Making the decision to use scaling is an important step in performing a principal component analysis.\n",

    "- Create a PCA model of pokemon without scaling, assigning the result to `pr.without.scaling`.\n",

    "#### 4.1.4) Variance explained\n",
    "In this exercise, you will produce scree plots showing the proportion of variance explained as the number of principal components increases. The data from PCA must be prepared for these plots, as there is not a built-in function in R to create them directly from the PCA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you look at these plots, ask yourself if there's an elbow in the amount of variance explained that might lead you to pick a natural number of principal components. If an obvious elbow does not exist, as is typical in real-world datasets, consider how else you might determine the number of principal components to retain based on the scree plot.\n",
