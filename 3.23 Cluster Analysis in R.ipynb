    "# Cluster Analysis in R\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Description\n",
    "Cluster analysis is a powerful toolkit in the data science workbench. It is used to find groups of observations (clusters) that share similar characteristics. These similarities can inform all kinds of business decisions; for example, in marketing, it is used to identify distinct groups of customers for which advertisements can be tailored. In this course, you will learn about two commonly used clustering methods - hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. You won't just learn how to use these methods, you'll build a strong intuition for how they work and how to interpret their results. You'll develop this intuition by exploring three different datasets: soccer player positions, wholesale customer spending data, and longitudinal occupational wage data.\n",

    "## 1) Calculating distance between observations\n",
    "Cluster analysis seeks(search) to find groups of observations that are similar to one another, but the identified groups are different from each other. This similarity/difference is captured by the metric called distance. In this chapter, you will learn how to calculate the distance between observations for both continuous and categorical features. You will also develop an intuition for how the scales of your features can affect distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) (video) What is cluster analysis?\n",
    "cluster analysis is form of data exploration and the key to harnessing its power lies in understand how it works, so in this course you won´t just learn the tools necessary to perform cluster analysis, that is the easu part, we 'll work with you to build  the intuation behind the underlying methods but before we get to the how let's take a momoment to disscus what is clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "we are working with a bunch of information, this data usually is represented as a matrix with rows (observation) and columns (that tell us something that we measured across these observation ) and we'll refer to these columns as the `features`  of our observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cluster analysis, we are interested in gruping our observation such all members of a grup are are similar to one another and at the same time they are distinctly different from all members outside of this group or put it another way, cluster analysis is a form of exploratory data anlysis (EDA) where observation are divide into meaningful group that share common characteristics amongset each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "so what is the flow of cluster analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- first your data does not have any missing values and that your features are on similar scales.\n",
    "- select similarity measure\n",
    "- cluster\n",
    "- analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) (video) Distance between two observations\n",
    "let's begin by focusing on the question that is fundamental to all  clustering analyses ...how similar are two observations? or from another perspective how dissimilar are they? you see, most clustering methods measure similarity between observations using a dissimilarity metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Distance = 1 - Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Often referred to as the distance, these two concept are just two sides of the same coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "if two observation have a large distance and then they are less similar  to one another, likewise if their distance value is small then they are more similar, naturally we should first develop a keen intuition by what is meant by distance \n",
    "\n",
    "for example we can use the euclidean distance to calculate this measure, if we have two point each of them have their (x,y) coordanates respectevily  then we can use this formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2) this is the fundamentai idea to calculate the distance between two point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R we can use `distance()` function, onlye need to add a data freme or matrix and the method that provides the distance is `method = euclidean`, this function becomes indespensable if we have more that 2 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "note that we use this function with more two observation it coul be expensive \n",

    "    - we saw the distance between 2 and 3 is 18.0\n",

    "As you recently learned, the process of hierarchical clustering involves iteratively grouping observations via pairwise comparisons until all observations are gather into a single group.We can representet this grouping visually using a plot called the `Dendogram`  also knows as a `Tree Digram` so build a Dendogram let´s start with the same six player soccer lineup from our last video.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left we have the positions of the players and on the right we will assemble a Dendogram as we iteratively group these observations, as before we can start the process of hierarchical clustering by taking the 2 closest observation (1 and 2) and gruping them, correspondingly we can represent this grouping in the tree diagram, the dendogram encodes a very important attribute of our grouping, the distance between the observations that were grouped, this is captered by the height axis, as before we will form the next closets group (5 and 6) , by comparing the pairwaise distances and linkage criteria-based distnace among observation and existing groups, the first group (1 and 2) forms now a new group with 4 and is according represented in the dendogram, the common branch between these 3 observations again encodes distance more specifilly it's a function of linkage criteria-based distance among all 3 observations, this is an importante feature of the dendogram, it allows us to say something very concrete about our grouped observations at any given height, remember that for distance we chose euclidean distance and linkage criteria used was the complete method, so we can continue until finshed to agrupe all our observations.\n",

    "To visualize a dendogram in R, we need to do is plot the corresponding `hclus` object "

    "### 2.3) (video)  Cutting the tree\n",
    "In the previous exercises you have learned how plot and interpret the Dendrogram now let's learn how to leverage this visualization to both identify our clusters and how highlight some of their key characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let´s continue work with the soccer player Dendrogram , remember the distance between the observations was calculated using  euclidean distance and we used the complete linkage criteria, that means that any given branch, all members that share this branch will have a euclidean distance amongst one another no greater than height of that branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can leverage this idea to both select our clusters and also characterize the relationships of their members, to do so, we can cut our tree at any desired height, let´s choose 15 for now, that means we remove all links above this cut point and we create our clusters below in this case two cluster are formed (5-6 and 1,2,4,3) using this cutoff we can alredy ascribe a characteristic to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can say all members of the created clusters will have a equal euclidean distance amongst each other not greater than our cut height of 15 , this statment is a functions of  our choice of height, distance metric and linkage criteria, this information can be very valuable as our data gets more features and becomes harders to plot using only two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize the cluster that form at any given height by leveraging the `dendextend` library to color our dendogram plot, to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we first must convert the `hclust` object into a dendogram object by using the function as (dot) dendrogram\n",
    "2. the next step is to use the `color_branches` function from `dendextend` package to color the branches based on a desired criteria, in this case we want to cut using a height of 15, we represented this using the parameter `h` \n",
    "3. Finally we use the `plot` function to plot the newly colored dendrogram \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this visual to further explore heights at which we may want to create our clusters, let´s say we believed a height of ten would be more appropiete, as shown in this plot with a proposed red line, we perform the steps to color the tree using an `h` equal to 10, the resulting dendrogram now has four colors for the corresponding four clousters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also leverage the `color_braches` to color the tree using `k` criteria by just providing our desired `k` like so our 3 plot."

    "### 2.4) (video) Making sense of the clusters\n",
    "over the last series of exercises, you've developed the tools that you need to run hierarchical clustering and the intuition to understand the impact of each step. Now you will have a chance to use these skills by clustering a new dataset, you will work with a series of 45 records of customer spendings from wholesale distribuitor, for each customer records you'll have 3 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- spending on milk \n",
    "- Grocery and \n",
    "- Frozen Food Spending\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset will look like this `head(customers_spend)` you will notice that unlike the soccer positions dataset, where we onlye have 2 features this dataset has 3, the concequence of this is that, we can´t simply explore what the cluster mean from a two dimensional plot, there are several approaches to overcome this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plot 2 dimensions at a time: once you have assigned the cluster memberships,you can make multiple plots with feature pairs and use the color to show the difference in clusters, this can be helpful, but  only captures one angle of the complex interactions at a time, also this approach can quickly get out  of hand when the numbers of features expands.\n",
    "- Visualize using PCA: You can use Dimensionality Reduction Methods such as principal component analysis in order to plot multi-dimensional data onto two dimensions and color the points using the cluster assigments, this can be helpful to see if your observations clustered well and the clusters are well seperated, hovewer this type of analysis is difficult to interpret and wouldn't shed light on the characteristics of the cluster \n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1) (video) Introduction to K-means\n",
    "In the last chapter you learned how to use the hierarchical clustering \n",
    "method to group observations, in this chapter you will learn about another popular method clustering called k-means clustering to learn how this method works, let's revisit an expended version of the soccer lineup data that you have been working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data consists in twelve playes on a soccer  field at the start of the game, at this point in the game the teams are positioned on  opposite sides of the field, we would expect that clustering can be affective in identifying teams and assigning each player to the correct team.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of k-means clustering involves a making a desciscion of how many clusters to generate , this is the 'k' in k-means clustering and this can be decided on in advance based on out understanding the data or it can be estimated from data empirically, in our case we can use k= 2, because we know that in a soccer field only can be two teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once k=2 is stablished the algoritm can proceed, the first step in k-means algorithm is to initialize k-points at random positions in the feature space, we'll refer to these points as the 'clusters centroids' or 'centroids'.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each observations the distance is calculated betweenthe observation and each centroid, in k-means clustering, the distance is limited euclidean only, the observations now have an initial assignment to one of the two clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step involves moving the centroides to the central points of the resulting clusters, again the distance of every observations is calculated to each centroid and they are re-assigned based on which centroid are closest too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until the centroids stabilize and the observetaions are no longer re-assigned, this is the fundemental algorithm of k-means clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the kmeans model in R you will use the function with the same name "

    "Here, this is represented by the dashed lines between the centroide and each observations (Image 1), while k=1 it is not really clustering, it can be helpul for the elbow analysis , as such we record the total within cluster sum of squeres for the value of k=1 (image 2), we repeat this step for k=2, you can see already see that the dashed lines are on average shorter and we can expect the total within cluster sum of squares to drop (image 3 and 4), which of course it does, same goes for a value of k=3,  and for k = 4 ... we can continue this calculation so long as k is less than our total number of observations, in this case we have calculated this for values of k from 1 through 10, you may notice a trend that as k increases the total within cluster sum of squeres keeps decreasing, this absolutely natural and expected, just think about it, the more you segment your data, the more your points just group together into a smaller and more compact clusters until you obtain many clusters with only one or two members.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are looking for is the point at which the curve beings to flatten out, affectionally referred to as the elbow, in these case we can see that there is a precipitous drop going from a k of 1 of 2 and the leveling off when moving between a k of 2 and 3 and onward, as such we can claim that the elbow in this case occurred where k=2 and would consider using this estimated value of k.\n",

    "The Closest Neighbor Distance for an observation is the average distance from that observation to the points of the closest neighboring cluster, it´s calculated for the red cluster like so (image 2) the blue cluster (image 3 ), the smallest average distance to out observation is then used as the closest neighbor distance, in this clase the blue cluster is clearly closer, using the values of C(i)  and N(i) the Silhouette width can be calculated as shown here (formula), more importantly is the intuitive interpretation of this value:\n",

    "- a value of 0, indicated that it´s on the border between two clusters and can possibly belong either one.\n",
    "- a value of -1 or close to -1, suggests that this observations has a better fit with the neighbor cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculated the Silhouette  Width for each observation by leveraging the `pam` function from the `cluster` library (note that pam function is very simliar but it isn't identicall to kmeans ).\n",

    "The `pam` function requieres a dataframe and a desired numbers of clusters provided by the parameter k, the Silhouette Width can be accessed from the `pam` model object as shown here or they can be visualized using the Silhouette plot like so."

    "#### 3.3.1) Silhouette analysis\n",
    "`Silhouette analysis` allows you to calculate how similar each observations is with the cluster it is assigned relative to other clusters. This metric (silhouette width) ranges from `-1` to `1` for each observation in your data and can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Values close to 1 suggest that the observation is well matched to the assigned cluster\n",
    "    Values close to 0 suggest that the observation is borderline matched between two clusters\n",
    "    Values close to -1 suggest that the observations may be assigned to the wrong cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will leverage the `pam()` and the `silhouette()` functions from the cluster library to perform silhouette analysis to compare the results of models with a k of 2 and a k of 3. You'll continue working with the lineup dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay close attention to the silhouette plot, does each observation clearly belong to its assigned cluster for k = 3?\n",

    "**Exercise**\n",

    "- Plot the silhouette analysis using `plot(silhouette(model))`.\n",
    "- Repeat the first two steps for `k = 3`, saving the model as `pam_k3`.\n",
    "- Make sure to review the differences between the plots before proceeding (especially observation 3) for pam_k3.\n",

    "*Answer*\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice that for k = 2, no observation has a silhouette width close to 0? What about the fact that for k = 3, observation 3 is close to 0 and is negative? This suggests that k = 3 is not the right number of clusters"

    "### 3.4) (video) Making sense of the K-means clusters\n",
    "through this chapter you have worked to develop an understanding and an intuition of how to use the k means algorithm and its associated techniques to perform clustering analysis, now it's time to put these tools into practice by revisting the whosale dataset, you have learned a lot since you've last looked at this data, so let´s have a quick reflesher it, the whosale dataset is an exercise in clustering the customer of a whosale distribuidor , this use of clustering is also known as market segmatation, the whosale data consists of 45 observations of client purchases for milk,grocery and frozen food.\n",
    "\n",
    "at the end of chapter 2, you used herarchical clustering to segment the customers into 4 clusters using a height that seemed appropiete based on the structure of the tree, you then characterized these customers segments by calculating the average of their spending in each category from this analysis you learned that segments 1,3 and 4 consist of around five observations each and their members  collectively spend more on one catergory relative to the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "in the real worl scenario a finding like this could be used to provide more customized advertising or other targeting for these groups based on their spending habits, do you think the result will be the be the same if you used a different method for clustering?\n",

    "#### 3.4.1) Revisiting wholesale data: \"Best\" k\n",
    "At the end of Chapter 2 you explored wholesale distributor data `customers_spend` using hierarchical clustering. This time you will analyze this data using the `k-means` clustering tools covered in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step will be to determine the \"best\" value of k using average `silhouette width`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A refresher about the data: it contains records of the amount spent by 45 different clients of a wholesale distributor for the food categories of Milk, Grocery & Frozen. This is stored in the data frame `customers_spend`. For this exercise you can assume that because the data is all of the same type (amount spent) and you will not need to scale it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "- Use `map_dbl()` to run `pam()` using the `customers_spend` data for k values ranging from 2 to 10 and extract the average silhouette width value from each model: `model$silinfo$avg.width` Store the resulting vector as `sil_width`\n",
    "- Build a new data frame `sil_df` containing the values of k and the vector of average silhouette widths\n",
    "- Use the values in `sil_df` to plot a line plot showing the relationship between k and average silhouette width\n",

    "From the plot I hope you noticed that k = 2 has the highest average sillhouette width and is the “best” value of k we will move forward with."

    "great job! you've successfully analyzed the occupation wage data using hierarchical clustering, now let's briefly discuss these results before moving on to kmeans clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that this distance dendogram was constructed using eucleadean distance and the average linkage criteria, what this means is that at height of any given branch, all observations belonging to that branch must have an average euclidean distance amongst each other less than or equal to heigth of that branch \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using a pre-determined value of k  when cutting the tree, you used the structure of the tree to make the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "A height of 100,000 seems reasonable when looking at this structure and generates 3 clustering, however, it would just be reasonable to go heigher to create two clusters or lower to create four, to better understant the consequence of the cut height, you explored the resulting clusters to see if they make sense, more specifically  you plotted the trends of these 3 clusters and used color to compare and constrast them , visually this seems to be reasonable clustering with 3 distinct trends or slops that emerge from  the 3 clusters based on this analysis, one observation we can make is that 2 occupations concurrently had a higher growth in average wages relative to the others these are the management and legal occupations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let´s revisit this data through the lens of k-mean clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "- evaluate whether pre-processing is necessary.\n",
    "- after that, the second step will be to empirically estiamte the valu of k using the two methods you have learned about, the elbow plit an the maximum average silhouette width \n",
    "- finally, as with any good clustering analysis, you will analyze your resulting clusters and find out what you can lear from them"

    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "- Use `map_dbl()` to run `kmeans()` using the `oes` data for k values ranging from 1 to 10 and extract the total within-cluster sum of squares value from each model: `model$tot.withinss`\n",

    "- Build a new data frame `elbow_df` containing the values of k and the vector of total within-cluster sum of squares\n",

    "1. The clusters generated by the hierarchical clustering all have members with a Euclidean distance amongst one another less than 100,000 and hence is the best clustering method.\n",

    "3. The clusters generated using k-means with a k = 7 has the largest Average Silhouette Widths among the cluster and hence is the best way to cluster this data.\n",
