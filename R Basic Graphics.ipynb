    "> If you try to plot factors, for example, plot() will automagically create a bar chart that nicely displays the number of occurences of each factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also pass plot() vectors; the data corresponding to the first argument is then shown on the horizontal x-axis, while the second vector will be plotted on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you already saw that the combination of a factor and a numeric vector already gave the surprising result of a categorized set of boxplots. But what happens if you pass the plot() function a single numeric vector? And what if you pass two vectors to plot()? No theory on this one, let's simply learn by doing!\n",
    "\n",
    " If you use plot() with a single argument (numerical), you'll get an index plot, while with two arguments you'll get a classical scatterplot. From the second plot, there seems to be a light correlation between the length of a movie and its rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Histogram\n",
    "Another function is hist(). Basically, the hist() function visualizes the distribution of your data by placing all values in bins and displaying the bin frequencies of each bin. Have a look at the usage of the hist() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "> hist(x, breaks = \"Sturges\")\n",
    "\n",
    "x is the vector of values for which you want to create a histogram. The breaks argument specifies how many bins, or histogram cells, your plot should contain. By default, the \"Sturges\" algorithm is used to automatically determine the number of bins.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea is create a grid with different type of plots at the same time, The easiest way to do is, is by specifying the graphical parameter `mfrow` with the `par()`, because it's often a good idea to combine different plots; this saves space but also allows readers to easily compare the plots.\n",

    "**Resetting this layout afterwards**, every time you have been adapting the graphical parameters,\n",

    "Must of them work out of the box; only for the `lines()` function it's important that you\n",
