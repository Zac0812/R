    "# Importing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second part to Importing Data in R, you will take a deeper dive into the wide range of data formats out there. More specifically, you'll learn how to import data from relational databases and how to import and work with data coming from the web. Finally, you'll get hands-on experience with importing data from statistical software packages such SAS, STATA and SPSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Importing data from databases \n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies store their information in relational databases. The R community has also developed R packages to get data from these architectures. You'll learn how to connect to a database and how to retrieve data from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) Connect to a database\n",
    "First of all we need a packages that allow us relation with the DB and it will depend our SGDB, fo example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MySQL - RMySQL\n",
    "2. PosgresSQL- RPostgresSQL\n",
    "3. Oracle- ROracle\n",
    "4. Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now, how R interact with the DB?, so which R functions you use to access and manipulate the DB, is specified in other R package called **DBI** in more technical terms, DBI is an interface and RmySQL is the implementation, so first we will install our RmySQL Packages, which automatically install the DBI package.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #First we need install our packages \n",
    "    install.packages(\"RMySQL\")\n",
    "    #library \"RmySQL not required yet!\n",
    "    library(DBI) \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### a) Establish a connection\n",
    "The first step to import data from a SQL database is creating a connection to it, you need different packages depending on the database you want to connect to. All of these packages do this in a uniform way, as specified in the DBI package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dbConnect()** creates a connection between your R session and a SQL database. The first argument has to be a **DBIdriver** object, that specifies how connections are made and how data is mapped between R and the database. Specifically for MySQL databases, you can build such a driver with **RMySQL::MySQL()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the MySQL database is a remote database hosted on a server, you'll also have to specify the following arguments in **dbConnect(): dbname, host, port, user and password**. Most of these details have already been provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Import table data\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've successfully connected to a remote MySQL database, the next step is to see what tables the database contains. You can do this with the **dbListTables()** function and the same way you can use **dbReadTable** to read a specific table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #First we need install our packages \n",
    "    install.packages(\"RMySQL\")\n",
    "    #library \"RmySQL not required yet!\n",
    "    library(DBI) \n",
    "\n",
    "    #  dbConnect() call\n",
    "    con <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), \n",
    "                     #dbname = \"tweater\", \n",
    "                     dbname = \"company\",\n",
    "                     host = \"courses.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\", \n",
    "                     port = 3306,\n",
    "                     user = \"student\",\n",
    "                     password = \"datacamp\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #To see the class\n",
    "    class(con)\n",
    "\n",
    "    #to see all tables\n",
    "    dbListTables(con)\n",
    "\n",
    "    #to read a specific table\n",
    "    dbReadTable(con,\"employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    #to disconnected \n",
    "    #dbDisconnect(con)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) SQL Queries from inside R\n",
    "In your life as a data scientist, you'll often be working with huge databases that contain tables with millions of rows. If you want to do some analyses on this data, it's possible that you only need a fraction of this data. In this case, it's a good idea to send SQL queries to your database, and only import the data you actually need into R.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dbGetQuery()** is what you need. As usual, you first pass the connection object to it. The second argument is an SQL query in the form of a character string, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    dbGetQuery(con, \"SELECT age FROM people WHERE gender = 'male'\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "the most important thing here that we can customize your sentence of sql and we won't have any problem with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) DBI internals\n",
    "You've used **dbGetQuery()** multiple times now. This is a virtual function from the DBI package, but is actually implemented by the RMySQL package. Behind the scenes, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sending the specified query with `dbSendQuery()`;\n",
    "2. Fetching the result of executing the query on the database with `dbFetch()`; You can specify the n argument inside dbFetch()\n",
    "3. Clearing the result with `dbClearResult()`  \n",
    "    \n",
    "So if we combined all these function, we will obtain the same result as **dbGetQuery()** , we do this, well **dbFetch** query allow us to specify a maximum numbers of records to retrieve per fetch, for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "    res<-dbSendQuery(con, \"SELECT age FROM people WHERE gender = 'male'\")\n",
    "    dbFetch(res)\n",
    "    dbClearResult(res)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### d) Disconnect  \n",
    "Every time you connect to a database using dbConnect(), you're creating a new connection to the database you're referencing. RMySQL automatically specifies a maximum of open connections and closes some of the connections for you, but still: it's always polite to manually disconnect from the database afterwards. You do this with the **dbDisconnect()** function.    "

    "## 2) Importing data from the web\n",
    "More and more of the information that data scientists are using resides on the web. Importing this data into R requires an understanding of the protocols used on the web. In this chapter, you'll get a crash course in HTTP and learn to perform your own HTTP requests from inside R.\n",

    "You will see that the **utils functions** to import flat file data, such as `read.csv() and read.delim()`, are capable of automatically importing from URLs that point to flat files on the web.\n",
    "\n",

    "When you learned about gdata, it was already mentioned that gdata can handle .xls files that are on the internet. readxl can't, at least not yet. The URL with which you'll be working is already available in the sample code. You will import it once using gdata and once with the readxl package via a workaround.\n",

    "In the previous example you've seen how you can read excel files on the web using the read_excel package by first downloading the file with the download.file() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's more: with download.file() you can download any kind of file from the web, using HTTP and HTTPS: images, executable files, but also .RData files. An RData file is very efficient format to store R data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can load data from an RData file using the load() function, but this function does not accept a URL string as an argument. In this exercise, you'll first download the RData file securely, and then import the local data file.\n",
