    "Functions are a fundamental building block of the R language. You've probably used dozens (or even hundreds) of functions written by others, but in order to take your R game to the next level, you'll need to learn to write your own functions. This course will teach you the fundamentals of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks.\n",

    "## 1) A quick refresher\n",

    "### 1.1) Writing a function\n",
    "\n",
    "The function template is a useful way to start writing a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_fun <- function(arg1, arg2) {\n",
    "      # body\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "my_fun is the variable that you want to assign your function to, arg1 and arg2 are arguments to the function. The template has two arguments, but you can specify any number of arguments, each separated by a comma. You then replace # body with the R code that your function will execute, referring to the inputs by the argument names you specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example we can built a function that calculate the radio i.e (x/y) of two values.\n",
    "    # Define ratio() function\n",
    "    ratio <- function(x, y) {\n",
    "      x/y\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Call ratio() with arguments 3 and 4\n",
    "    ratio(3,4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don´t forget that exists two ways to specify the arguments, in the previous example you probably either did ratio(3, 4), which relies on matching by **position**, or ratio(x = 3, y = 4), which relies on matching by **name**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice that when you call a function, you should place a space around = in function calls, and always put a space after a comma, not before (just like in regular English). Using whitespace makes it easier to skim the function for the important components.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) Scoping\n",
    "Describes how R look up values when give a name, but it´s important to know how R looking for into a function, when a function is called, the function begins execution in a new working enviroment, (example 1)\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: if a variable didn´t exist in the global enviroment the function will return an error, since this variable isn´t defined locally or at any higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoping discribe only where, not when, to look up for a variable, this means it´s possible the retunr value of a function could depend on when you call it (example 3)\n"

    "Writing your own functions is one way to reduce duplication in your code. In this chapter, you'll learn when to write a function, how to get started and what to keep in mind when you are writing. You'll also learn to appreciate that functions have two audiences: the computer (which runs the code) and humans (who need to be able to understand the code).\n",

    "### 3.3.1) Using an anonymous function\n",
    "Great! We now have a snippet of code that performs the operation we want on one data frame. One option would be to turn this into a function, for example:\n",

    "Writing anonymous functions takes a lot of extra key strokes, so purrr provides a shortcut that allows you to write an anonymous function as a one-sided formula instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, a one-sided formula starts with a ~, followed by an R expression. In purrr's map functions, the R expression can refer to an element of the .x argument using the . character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example. Imagine, instead of a regression on each data frame in cyl, we wanted to know the mean displacement for each data frame. One way to do this would be to use an anonymous function:\n",

    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.3.3) Using a string\n",
    "There are also some useful shortcuts that come in handy when you want to subset each element of the .x argument. If the .f argument to a map function is set equal to a string, let's say \"name\", then purrr extracts the \"name\" element from every element of .x.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a really common situation you find yourself in when you work with nested lists. For example, if we have a list of where every element contains an a and b element:\n",

    "      list(a = 1, b = \"A\"), \n",

    "    \n",
    "We might want to pull out the **a** element from every entry. We could do it with the string shortcut like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "    # Save the result from the previous exercise to the variable models\n",

    "    \n",
    "### 3.3.4) Using a numeric vector\n",
    "Another useful shortcut for subsetting is to pass a numeric vector as the .f argument. This works just like passing a string but subsets by index rather than name. For example, with your previous list_of_results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    list_of_results <- list(\n",

    "### 3.3.5) Putting it together with pipes\n",
    "purrr also includes a pipe operator: %>%. The pipe operator is another shortcut that saves typing, but also increases readability. The explanation of the pipe operator is quite simple: x %>% f(y) is another way of writing f(x, y). That is, the left hand side of the pipe, x, becomes the first argument to the function, f(), on the right hand side of the pipe.\n",
    "\n",

    "      map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))\n",
    "      \n",
    "We read this as \"split the data frame mtcars on cyl, then use map() on the result.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful things about the pipe is we can chain together many operations. Here is our complete code, written with pipes, instead assigning each step to a variable and using it in the next step:\n",

    "Instead, it always returns a list with two elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. result is the original result. If there was an error, this will be NULL.\n",

    "Roboust function either return the correct result or they fail with a clear error message, we will see that o lot of problems arise because of a fundamental tension in R: R is both an environment for interactive data analysis and a progamming language, so when you are doing interactive analysis, you want to iterate quicly possible and you check each result as you go that means functionss designed for interactive use can be helpulf;they can guess what you want and if they guess wrong it´s no big deal on the other hand, functions designed for programming should be robust you´re not working with them interactively so sometimes is helpulf isn´t helpuf!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main classes of functions that area often helpful for interactive usage, but can cause problems when writing functions \n",

    "1. Type-unstable functions, returns different types of things, for example with one type of input they might return a vector, but with another type they return data frame or matrix.\n",
    "2. Non-standard evaluation, is a very important part of R´s magic, it lets you use incredibly succinct APIs, like ggplot2 and dplyr, but introduces some ambiguity, which you need to be careful about when programming \n",
    "3. Hidden arguments, R has global options, wich can effect the operetion of ceratain functions, the most notorious of these is StringAsFactors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before to star we will learn, how your functions throw an informative error message instead of returning incorrect or surprising results.\n",

    "Now, let's see how this function might fail. There are two instances in which the non-standard evaluation of filter() could cause surprising results:\n",

    "    There is a threshold column in df.\n",

    "To avoid the problems caused by non-standard evaluation functions, you could avoid using them. In our example, we could achieve the same results by using standard subsetting (i.e. []) instead of filter(). For more insight into dealing with NSE and how to write your own non-standard evaluation functions, we recommend reading Hadley's vignette on the topic. Also, programming with the NSE functions in dplyr will be easier in a future version.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do need to use non-standard evaluation functions, it's up to you to provide protection against the problem cases. That means you need to know what the problem cases are, to check for them, and to fail explicitly.\n",

    "That's because if the argument stringsAsFactors isn't specified, it inherits its value from getOption(\"stringsAsFactors\"), a global option that a user may change.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is, however, okay to have side effects of a function depend on global options. For example, the print() function uses getOption(\"digits\") as the default for the digits argument.
