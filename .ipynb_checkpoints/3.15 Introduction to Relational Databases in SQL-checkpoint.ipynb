    "### Course Description\n",
    "You have already used SQL for querying data from databases. But did you actually know that there's a whole lot more you can do with databases? You can model different phenomena in your data – and relationships between them. This gives your data structure as well as consistency, which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life data set that was used to investigate questionable affiliations of universities. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of databases. In between, you'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships as well as how to enforce data integrity. Also, you'll discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraint\n",

    "From 0 to 100 in 10 seconds! In this chapter, you'll create your very first database with a set of simple SQL commands. After that, you'll migrate data from existing flat tables into that database. At the same time, you'll learn how meta information about a database can be queried.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.1) Query information_schema with SELECT\n",
    "`information_schema` is a meta-database that holds information about your current database. `information_schema` has multiple tables you can query with the known `SELECT * FROM` syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    tables: information about all tables in your current database\n",
    "    columns: information about all columns in all of the tables in your current database\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this exercise, you'll only need information from the `'public'` schema, which is specified as the column `table_schema` of the `tables` and `columns` tables. The `'public'` schema holds information about user-defined tables and databases. The other types of `table_schema` hold system information – for this course, you're only interested in user-defined stuff.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 ) CREATE your first few TABLEs\n",
    "You'll now start implementing a better database model. For this, you'll create tables for the `professors` and `universities` entity types. The other tables will be created for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating simple tables is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "     column_a data_type,\n",
    "     column_b data_type,\n",
    "     column_c data_type\n",
    "    );\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Attention: Table and columns names, as well as data types, don't need to be surrounded by quotation marks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a table professors with two text columns: firstname and lastname\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Create a table for the professors entity type\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE professors (\n",
    "     firstname text,\n",
    "     lastname text\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Print the contents of this table\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",
    "    FROM professors\n",
    "    \n",
    "Create a table universities with three text columns: university_shortname, university, and university_city.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Create a table for the universities entity type\n",
    "\n",
    "    create table universities (\n",

    "    university text,\n",
    "    university_city text\n",

    "    -- Print the contents of this table\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",
    "    FROM universities\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 1.2.3) ADD a COLUMN with ALTER TABLE\n",
    "Oops! We forgot to add the `university_shortname` column to the professors table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 4 of this course, you'll need this column for connecting the `professors` table with the `universities` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, adding columns to existing tables is easy, especially if they're still empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add columns you can use the following SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alter professors to add the text column university_shortname\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Add the university_shortname column\n",
    "    alter table professors\n",

    "    FROM professors\n",
    "     \n",
    "### 1.3 (video) Update your database as the structure changes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1) RENAME and DROP COLUMNs in affiliations\n",
    "As mentioned in the video, the still empty affiliations table has some flaws. In this exercise, you'll correct them as outlined in the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use the following queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "To rename columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name;\n",
    "To delete columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    DROP COLUMN column_name;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "Delete the university_shortname column in affiliations\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Rename the organisation column\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE affiliations\n",
    "    RENAME column organisation TO organization;\n",

    "    alter table affiliations\n",
    "    drop column university_shortname;\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 1.3.2) Migrate data with INSERT INTO SELECT DISTINCT\n",
    "Now it's finally time to migrate the data into the new tables. You'll use the following pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "    INSERT INTO ... \n",
    "    SELECT DISTINCT ... \n",
    "    FROM ...;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert all DISTINCT professors from university_professors into professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Insert unique professors into the new table\n",
    "    insert into professors \n",
    "    SELECT DISTINCT firstname, lastname, university_shortname \n",
    "    FROM university_professors;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Doublecheck the contents of professors\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",
    "    FROM professors;\n",
    "    \n",
    "Insert all DISTINCT affiliations into affiliations\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Insert unique affiliations into the new table\n",
    "    insert into affiliations \n",
    "    select distinct firstname, lastname, function, organization \n",
    "    FROM university_professors;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Doublecheck the contents of affiliations\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",
    "    FROM affiliations;\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 1.3.3) Delete tables with DROP TABLE\n",
    "Obviously, the `university_professors` table is now no longer needed and can safely be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For table deletion, you can use the simple command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    DROP TABLE table_name;    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete the university_professors table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    drop  table university_professors;\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2.0) Enforce data consistency with attribute constraints\n",
    "After having built a simple database, it's time to make use of the first cool features. You'll specify data types on columns, enforce column uniqueness, and disallow \"NULL\" values in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1) (video) Better data quality with constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1) Conforming with data types\n",
    "For demonstration purposes, I created a fictional database table that only holds three records. The columns have the data types date, integer, and text, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE transactions (\n",
    "     transaction_date date, \n",
    "     amount integer,\n",
    "     fee text\n",
    "    );\n",
    "Have a look at the contents of the transactions table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transaction_date` accepts `date` values. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, it accepts values in the form of `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD/MM/YY`, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both columns `amount` and `fee` appear to be numeric, however, the latter is modeled as text – which you will account for in the next exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2) Type CASTs\n",
    "In the video, you saw that type casts are a possible solution for data type issues. If you know that a certain column stores numbers as text, you can cast the column to a numeric form, i.e. to integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT CAST(some_column AS integer)\n",
    "    FROM table;\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, the `some_column` column is temporarily represented as `integer` instead of `text`, meaning that you can perform numeric calculations on the column,like : \n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Calculate the net amount as amount + fee\n",
    "    SELECT transaction_date, amount + cast(fee as integer) AS net_amount \n",
    "    FROM transactions;\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.2) (video) Working with data types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1) Change types with ALTER COLUMN\n",
    "The syntax for changing the data type of a column is straightforward. The following code changes the data type of the column_name column in table_name to varchar(10):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    ALTER COLUMN column_name\n",
    "    TYPE varchar(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to start adding constraints to your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "specify a fixed-length character type with the correct length for university_shortname.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Specify the correct fixed-length character type\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE professors\n",
    "    ALTER COLUMN university_shortname\n",
    "    TYPE char(3);\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the type of the firstname column to varchar(64)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Change the type of firstname\n",
    "    alter table professors\n",
    "    alter column firstname\n",
    "    TYPE varchar(64);\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2.2.2)  Convert types USING a function\n",
    "If you don't want to reserve too much space for a certain varchar column, you can truncate the values before converting its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, you can use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    ALTER COLUMN column_name\n",
    "    TYPE varchar(x)\n",
    "    USING SUBSTRING(column_name FROM 1 FOR x)\n",
    "    \n",
    "You should read it like this: Because you want to reserve only `x` characters for `column_name`, you have to retain a `SUBSTRING` of every value, i.e. the first `x` characters of it, and throw away the rest. This way, the values will fit the `varchar(x)` requirement.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**exercise**\n",
    "Run the sample code as is and take note of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE professors \n",
    "    ALTER COLUMN firstname \n",
    "    TYPE varchar(16)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > value too long for type character varying(16)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now use SUBSTRING() to reduce firstname to 16 characters so its type can be altered to varchar(16).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Convert the values in firstname to a max. of 16 characters\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE professors \n",
    "    ALTER COLUMN firstname \n",
    "    TYPE varchar(16)\n",
    "    using substring(firstname from 1 for 16)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.3) (video)The not-null and unique constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.1)Disallow NULL values with SET NOT NULL\n",
    "The professors table is almost ready now. However, it still allows for `NULL`s to be entered. Although some information might be missing about some professors, there's certainly columns that always need to be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "Add a not-null constraint for the firstname column.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Disallow NULL values in firstname\n",
    "    alter table professors \n",
    "    ALTER COLUMN firstname SET NOT NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a not-null constraint for the lastname column.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Disallow NULL values in lastname\n",
    "    alter table professors\n",
    "    alter column lastname set NOT NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2) Make your columns UNIQUE with ADD CONSTRAINT\n",
    "As seen in the video, you add the `UNIQUE` keyword after the `column_name` that should be unique. This, of course, only works for new tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "     column_name UNIQUE\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add a unique constraint to an existing table, you do it like that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    ADD CONSTRAINT some_name UNIQUE(column_name);\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is different from the `ALTER COLUMN` syntax for the `not-null` constraint. Also, you have to give the constraint a name `some_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a unique constraint to the university_shortname column in universities. Give it the name university_shortname_unq.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Make universities.university_shortname unique\n",
    "    ALTER table universities\n",
    "    ADD constraint university_shortname_unq UNIQUE(university_shortname);\n",
    "    \n",
    "Add a unique constraint to the organization column in organizations. Give it the name organization_unq.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Make organizations.organization unique\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE organizations\n",
    "    add constraint organization_unq unique(organization)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 3) Uniquely identify records with key constraints\n",
    "Now we're getting into database engineering at its best. It's time to add so-called primary and foreign keys to the tables. They are one of the most important concepts in databases – and will be the building blocks of relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1)(video) Keys and superkeys\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1) Get to know SELECT COUNT DISTINCT\n",
    "Your database doesn't have any defined keys so far, and you don't know which columns or combinations of columns are suited as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a simple way of finding out whether a certain column (or a combination) contains only unique values – and thus identifies the records in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You already know the `SELECT DISTINCT` query from the first chapter. Now you just have to wrap everything within the `COUNT()` function and PostgreSQL will return the number of unique rows for the given columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(column_a, column_b, ...))\n",
    "    FROM table;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "First, find out the number of rows in universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Count the number of rows in universities\n",
    "    SELECT count(*) \n",
    "    FROM universities;\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then, find out how many unique values there are in the university_city column.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Count the number of distinct values in the university_city column\n",
    "    SELECT count(distinct(university_city)) \n",
    "    FROM universities;\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3.1.2) Identify keys with SELECT COUNT DISTINCT\n",
    "There's a very basic way of finding out what qualifies for a key in an existing, populated table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Count the distinct records for all possible combinations of columns. If the resulting number x equals the number of all rows in the table for a combination, you have discovered a superkey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then remove one column after another until you can no longer remove columns without seeing the number x decrease. If that is the case, you have discovered a (candidate) key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table professors has 551 rows. It has only one possible candidate key, which is a combination of two attributes. You might want to try different combinations using the \"Run code\" button. Once you have found the solution, you can submit your answer.    \n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "Using the above steps, identify the candidate key by trying out different combination of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Try out different combinations\n",
    "    select COUNT(distinct(firstname, lastname)) \n",
    "    FROM professors;\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.2)(video)  Primary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.2) ADD key CONSTRAINTs to the tables\n",
    "Two of the tables in your database already have well-suited candidate keys consisting of one column each: `organizations` and `universities` with the `organization` and `university_shortname` columns, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll specify primary key constraints for these columns and rename them to `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding primary key constraints is as straightforward as adding unique constraints (see the last exercise of Chapter 2):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "    ADD CONSTRAINT some_name PRIMARY KEY (column_name)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that you can also specify more than one column in the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rename the organization column to id in organizations.\n",
    "Make id a primary key and name it organization_pk.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Rename the organization column to id\n",
    "    alter table organizations\n",
    "    rename column organization TO id;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Make id a primary key\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE organizations\n",
    "    ADD CONSTRAINT organization_pk primary key (id);\n",
    "    \n",
    "Rename the university_shortname column to id in universities.\n",
    "Make id a primary key and name it university_pk.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Rename the university_shortname column to id\n",
    "    alter table universities \n",
    "    rename column university_shortname to id;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Make id a primary key\n",
    "    alter table universities \n",
    "    add constraint university_pk primary key (id);\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.3)(video)  Surrogate keys\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1) Add a SERIAL surrogate key\n",
    "Since there's no single column candidate key in professors (only a composite key candidate consisting of firstname, lastname), you'll add a new column id to that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This column has a special data type serial, which turns the column into an auto-incrementing number. This means that, whenever you add a new professor to the table, it will automatically get an id that does not exist yet in the table: a perfect primary key!.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise** \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new column id with data type serial to the professors table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make id a primary key and name it professors_pkey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Add the new column to the table\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE professors \n",
    "    ADD COLUMN id serial;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Make id a primary key\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE professors \n",
    "    ADD CONSTRAINT professors_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Have a look at the first 10 rows of professors\n",
    "    select * from professors LIMIT 10;\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3.3.2) CONCATenate columns to a surrogate key\n",
    "Another strategy to add a surrogate key to an existing table is to concatenate existing columns with the CONCAT() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think of the following example table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE cars (\n",
    "     make varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n",
    "     model varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n",
    "     mpg integer NOT NULL\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    \n",
    "The table is populated with 10 rows of completely fictional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the table doesn't have a primary key yet. None of the columns consists of only unique values, so some columns can be combined to form a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of the following exercises, you will combine make and model into such a surrogate key.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1) REFERENCE a table with a FOREIGN KEY\n",
    "In your database, you want the professors table to reference the universities table. You can do that by specifying a column in professors table that references a column in the universities table.\n",
    "\n",
    "As just shown in the video, the syntax for that looks like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALTER TABLE a \n",
    "    ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES b (id);\n",
    "\n",
    "Table `a` should now refer to table `b`, via `b_id`, which points to `id`. `a_fkey` is, as usual, a constraint name you can choose on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention to the naming convention employed here: Usually, a foreign key referencing another primary key with name id is named `x_id`, where `x` is the name of the referencing table in the singular form.\n",

    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",

    "    -- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities\n",
    "    alter table professors\n",
    "    add constraint professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4.1.2) Explore foreign key constraints\n",
    "Foreign key constraints help you to keep order in your database mini-world. In your database, for instance, only professors belonging to Swiss universities should be allowed, as only Swiss universities are part of the universities table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foreign key on professors referencing universities you just created thus makes sure that only existing universities can be specified when inserting new data. Let's test this!\n",

    "### 4.2) (video) Model more complex relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1) Add foreign keys to the \"affiliations\" table\n",
    "At the moment, the affiliations table has the structure {firstname, lastname, function, organization}, as you can see in the preview at the bottom right. In the next three exercises, you're going to turn this table into the form {professor_id, organization_id, function}, with professor_id and organization_id being foreign keys that point to the respective tables.\n",

    "Now it's time to also populate `professors_id`. You'll take the `ID` directly from `professors`.\n",

    "    UPDATE table_a\n",
    "    SET column_to_update = table_b.column_to_update_from\n",
    "    FROM table_b\n",
    "    WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND ...;\n",
    "    This query does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each row in `table_a`, find the corresponding row in `table_b` where `condition1`, `condition2`, etc., are met.\n",
    "2. Set the value of `column_to_update` to the value of `column_to_update_from` (from that corresponding row).\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions usually compare other columns of both tables, e.g. `table_a.some_column = table_b.some_column`. Of course, this query only makes sense if there is only one matching row in `table_b`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, have a look at the current state of affiliations by fetching 10 rows and all columns.\n",
    "2. Update the professor_id column with the corresponding value of the id column in professors.\n",
    "   \"Corresponding\" means rows in professors where the firstname and lastname are identical to the ones in affiliations.\n",
    "3. Check out the first 10 rows and all columns of affiliations again. Have the professor_ids been correctly matched?   \n",
    "\n",

    "### 4.3.2) Change the referential integrity behavior of a key\n",

    "These foreign keys currently have the behavior `ON DELETE NO ACTION`. Here, you're going to change that behavior for the column referencing organizations from affiliations. If an organization is deleted, all its affiliations (by any professor) should also be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Altering a key constraint doesn't work with `ALTER COLUMN`. Instead, you have to delete the key constraint and then add a new one with a different `ON DELETE` behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For deleting constraints, though, you need to know their name. This information is also stored in information_schema\n",
    "\n",
