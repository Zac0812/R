    "# Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive tutorial, you will learn how to perform sophisticated dplyr techniques to carry out your data manipulation with R. First you will master the five verbs of R data manipulation with dplyr: select, mutate, filter, arrange and summarise. Next, you will learn how you can chain your dplyr operations using the pipe operator of the magrittr package. In the final section, the focus is on practicing how to subset your data using the group_by function, and how you can access data stored outside of R in a database. All said and done, you will be familiar with data manipulation tools and techniques that will allow you to efficiently manipulate data.\n",

    "# A) Introduction to dplyr and tbls\n",
    "Introduction to the dplyr package and the tbl class. Learn the philosophy that guides dplyr, discover some useful applications of the dplyr package, and meet the data structures that dplyr uses behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "dplyr introduces a grammar of data manupulation and tha same time you´ll also learn to use dplyr´s tbl structure and the piping operator; two features that can save you tons of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Load the dplyr and hflights package\n",
    "Welcome to the interactive exercises part of your dplyr course. Here you will learn the ins and outs of working with dplyr. dplyr is an R package, a collection of functions and data sets that enhance the R language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course you will use dplyr to analyze a data set of airline flight data containing flights that departed from Houston. This data is stored in a package called hflights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both dplyr and hflights are already installed on DataCamp's servers, so loading them with library() will get you up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Load the dplyr package\n",
    "    library(\"dplyr\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    #Load the hflights package. A variable called hflights will become available, a data.frame representing the data set.\n",
    "    # Load the hflights package\n",
    "    library(\"hflights\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Call both head() and summary() on hflights\n",
    "    head(hflights)\n",
    "    summary(hflights)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) tbl, a special type of data.frame\n",
    "if we started to work with our data frame \"hflights\" is possible that we have some problems with them as it´s very long.\n",
    "\n",
    "dplyr provides a new data structure for r **tbl** , a tbl is a special data frame but R know how to display it properly, for this we need :\n",
    "\n",
    "    hflights2<-tbl_df(hflights)\n",
    "    \n",
    "with this, you can display the amount of data that will fit in your console window.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can use the function **glimpse** shows you data type and the initial values of each column in the dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "    glimpse(hflights2)\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you don´t like the tbl format, you can change your structure back with somenthing like as **as.data.frame(dataset)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1) Convert data.frame to tibble\n",
    "As Garrett explained, a tbl (pronounced tibble) is just a special kind of data.frame. They make your data easier to look at, but also easier to work with. On top of this, it is straightforward to derive a tbl from a data.frame structure using as_tibble().\n",
    "\n",
    "The tbl format changes how R displays your data, but it does not change the data's underlying data structure. A tbl inherits the original class of its input, in this case, a data.frame. This means that you can still manipulate the tbl as if it were a data.frame. In other words, you can do anything with the hflights tbl that you could do with the hflights data.frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Both the dplyr and hflights packages are loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Convert the hflights_df data.frame into a hflights tbl\n",

    "    \n",
    "### 2.2) Changing labels of hflights, part 1 of 2\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit of cleaning would be a good idea since the UniqueCarrier variable of hflights uses a confusing code system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, let's work with a lookup table, that comes in the form of a named vector. When you subset the lookup table with a character string (like the character strings in UniqueCarrier), R will return the values of the lookup table that correspond to the names in the character string. To see how this works, run following code in the console:\n",
    "\n",
    "    two <- c(\"AA\", \"AS\")\n",
    "    lut <- c(\"AA\" = \"American\", \n",
    "             \"AS\" = \"Alaska\", \n",

    "    two <- lut[two]\n",
    "    two    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a new Carrier column to hflights by combining lut with the UniqueCarrier column of hflights.\n",
    "2. It's rather hard to see if you did things right, since the Carrier variable does not appear when you print hflights. Use the glimpse() function on hflights instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Both the dplyr and hflights packages are loaded into workspace\n",
    "    lut <- c(\"AA\" = \"American\", \"AS\" = \"Alaska\", \"B6\" = \"JetBlue\", \"CO\" = \"Continental\", \n",

    "# B) Select and mutate\n",
    "Get familiar with dplyr's manipulation verbs. Meet the five verbs and then practice using the mutate and select verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) The five verbs and select in more detail\n",
    "dbplyr does more than provide a new data structure, it provides a complete grammar for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. select: which removes columns from a dataset i.e it returns a subset of the columns\n",
    "    b. filter: which removes rows i.e it  returns a subset of the rows\n",
    "    c. arrange: which reorders the rows in a dataset\n",
    "    d. mutate: which uses data to build new columns of values\n",
    "    e. summarize: which calculates summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) The select verb\n",
    "To answer the simple question whether flight delays tend to shrink or grow during a flight, we can safely discard a lot of the variables of each flight. To select only the ones that matter, we can use select().\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, take the following call, that selects the variables var1 and var2 from the data frame df.\n",
    "\n",
    "    select(df, var1, var2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can also use **:** to select a range of variables and **-** to exclude some variables, similar to indexing a data.frame with square brackets. You can use both variable's names as well as integer indexes. This call selects the four first variables except for the second one of a data frame df:\n",
    "\n",
    "    select(df, 1:4, -2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "select() does not change the data frame it is called on; you have to explicitly assign the result of select() to a variable to store the result.   \n",
    " \n",
    "    # hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.\n",
    "    # Print out a tbl with the four columns of hflights related to delay\n",
    "    select(hflights, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print out the columns Origin up to Cancelled of hflights\n",
    "    select(hflights, 14:19)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Answer to last question: be concise! Find the most concise way to select: columns Year up to and including DayOfWeek, columns ArrDelay up to and including Diverted. You can examine the order of the variables in hflights with names(hflights) in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "    names(hflights)\n",
    "    select(hflights, 1:4, 12:21)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) Helper functions for variable selection\n",
    "dplyr comes with a set of helper functions that can help you select groups of variables inside a select() call:\n",
    "\n",
    "    starts_with(\"X\"): every name that starts with \"X\",\n",
    "    ends_with(\"X\"): every name that ends with \"X\",\n",
    "    contains(\"X\"): every name that contains \"X\",\n",
    "    matches(\"X\"): every name that matches \"X\", where \"X\" can be a regular expression,\n",
    "    num_range(\"x\", 1:5): the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04 and x05,\n",
    "    one_of(x): every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention here: When you refer to columns directly inside select(), you don't use quotes. If you use the helper functions, you do use quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # As usual, hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print out a tbl containing just ArrDelay and DepDelay\n",
    "    select(hflights, ends_with(\"Delay\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print out a tbl as described UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, Cancelled, and CancellationCode, using both helper functions and variable names\n",
    "    select(hflights, UniqueCarrier, ends_with(\"Num\"), starts_with(\"Cancel\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print out tbl as described DepTime, ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay, using only helper functions.\n",
    "    select(hflights, contains(\"Tim\"), contains(\"Del\"))\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 1.3) Comparison to base R\n",
    "To see the added value of the dplyr package, it is useful to compare its syntax with base R. Up to now, you have only considered functionality that is also available without the use of dplyr. The elegance and ease-of-use of dplyr is a great plus though.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # both hflights and dplyr are available\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Finish select call so that ex1d matches ex1r\n",
    "    ex1r <- hflights[c(\"TaxiIn\", \"TaxiOut\", \"Distance\")]\n",

    "    ex3d <- select(hflights, starts_with(\"T\"))\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2)Mutate      \n",
    "it´s add new variable tp a data set, because it builds the new variable out of data that already exist in the dataset, its sintaxis is very similar as select:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mutate(dataset, new_column_name = expression )\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # hflights and dplyr are loaded and ready to serve you.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add the new variable ActualGroundTime to a copy of hflights and save the result as g1.\n",
    "    g1<-mutate(hflights, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime-AirTime)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add the new variable GroundTime to g1. Save the result as g2.\n",
    "    g2<-mutate(g1, GroundTime = TaxiIn + TaxiOut)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add the new variable AverageSpeed to g2. Save the result as g3.\n",
    "    g3<-mutate(g2, AverageSpeed = 60*Distance/AirTime)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print out g3\n",
    "    g3\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.1) Add multiple variables using mutate\n",
    "So far you've added variables to hflights one at a time, but you can also use mutate() to add multiple variables at once. To create more than one variable, place a comma between each variable that you define inside mutate().\n",
    "\n",
    "mutate() even allows you to use a new variable while creating a next variable in the same call. In this example, the new variable x is directly reused to create the new variable y:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mutate(my_df, x = a + b, y = x + c)\n",
    "    \n",

    "# c) Filter and arrange\n",
    "Learn how to search through the observations in your data set (and extract useful observations) with the filter function. Rearrange the observations in your data set with the arrange verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) the third of five verbs: filter\n",
    "if we want to use this verb we need to know its estructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filter(source, logical)\n",
    "\n",
    "for this verb it's necessary to know the logical operators, for this we can type ?Comparison like :`>, >= , <, <=, == , !=, is.na or !is.na `\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) Logical operators\n",
    "R comes with a set of logical operators that you can use inside filter():\n",
    "\n",
    "    x < y, TRUE if x is less than y\n",
    "    x <= y, TRUE if x is less than or equal to y\n",
    "    x == y, TRUE if x equals y\n",

    "    x > y, TRUE if x is greater than y\n",
    "    x %in% c(a, b, c), TRUE if x is in the vector c(a, b, c)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example filters df such that only the observations for which a is positive, are kept:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filter(df, a > 0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # hflights is at your disposal as a tbl, with clean carrier names\n",
    "    str(hflights)\n",
    "    # All flights that traveled 3000 miles or more\n",
    "    filter(hflights, Distance>= 3000)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # All flights flown by one of JetBlue, Southwest, or Delta\n",
    "    filter(hflights, UniqueCarrier %in% c(\"JetBlue\", \"Southwest\", \"Delta\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # All flights where taxiing took longer than flying\n",
    "    filter(hflights, (TaxiIn + TaxiOut) > AirTime)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) Combining tests using boolean operators\n",
    "R also comes with a set of boolean operators that you can use to combine multiple logical tests into a single test. These include & (and), | (or), and ! (not). Instead of using the & operator, you can also pass several logical tests to filter(), separated by commas. The following two calls are completely equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filter(df, a > 0 & b > 0)\n",
    "    filter(df, a > 0, b > 0)\n",
    "Next, is.na() will also come in handy. This example keeps the observations in df for which the variable x is not NA:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filter(df, !is.na(x))\n",
    "    \n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # hflights is at your service as a tbl!\n",

    "So far, you have learned three data manipulation functions in the dplyr package. Time for a summarizing exercise.
