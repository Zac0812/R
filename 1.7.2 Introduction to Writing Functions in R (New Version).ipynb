    "### Course Description\n",
    "Being able to write your own functions makes your analyses more readable, with fewer errors, and more reusable from project to project. Function writing will increase your productivity more than any other skill! In this course you'll learn the basics of function writing, focusing on the arguments going into the function and the return values. You'll be writing useful data science functions, and using real-world data on Wyoming tourism, stock price/earnings ratios, and grain yields.\n",
